## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/microsoft/purview-dlm-mcp.git
   cd purview-dlm-mcp
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Build:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Running Tests

The test suite uses Vitest and includes unit tests (67 tests, no Exchange Online required), E2E tests (30 tests), and TSG integration tests (~14 tests).

To run **unit tests only** (no Exchange Online connection needed):

```bash
npm test
```

To run the **full suite** (E2E + TSG tests require a live Exchange Online environment), set the following environment variables:

```bash
export DLM_UPN=admin@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com
export DLM_ORGANIZATION=yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com
```

Then run:

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

E2E and TSG tests use interactive MSAL authentication — a browser window will open for sign-in on first run.
